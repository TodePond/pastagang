# Currently untitled pastagang paper

## Abstract

This is a first attempt at an abstract. Pastagang is an accidental emergent group that formed in late 2024. In this paper, various participants share their personal experiences of the phenomena. This is Lu writing this right now but I'm pretty sure all of these words will get deleted at some point. Words can be added or edited or removed anywhere. Who knows if people will do this or not. Maybe soon, or maybe months from now.

## Currently untitled introduction

## Cursors

> Analogous to the pulsing live body within other forms of performance, the flashing cursor marks the point of decision-making – of consciousness perhaps – within the live programming of code; the movement of the coder’s thinking as its oscillates between sense-making through the discontinuous, abstract notational form of code and the ‘continuous’ – even sensuous – experience of coding as a lived experience.

Pastagang has been one of the most ... of my life. ...

For me, **jamming** means high levels of trust, listening and making space for others. I hope to take these skills into other areas of my life...
