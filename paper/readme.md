# Currently untitled pastagang paper

## Abstract

This is a first attempt at an abstract. Pastagang is an accidental emergent group that formed in late 2024. In this paper, various participants share their personal experiences of the phenomena. This is Lu writing this right now but I'm pretty sure all of these words will get deleted at some point. Words can be added or edited or removed anywhere. Who knows if people will do this or not. Maybe soon, or maybe months from now.
