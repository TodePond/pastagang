## Abstract

This is a first attempt at an abstract. Pastagang is an accidental emergent group that formed in late 2024. In this paper, various participants reflect on their personal experiences of the phenomena. This is Lu writing this right now but I'm pretty sure all of these words will get deleted at some point. Words can be added or edited or removed anywhere. Who knows if people will do this or not. Maybe soon, or maybe months from now.

## Currently untitled introduction

## Cursors

> Analogous to the pulsing live body within other forms of performance, the flashing cursor marks the point of decision-making – of consciousness perhaps – within the live programming of code; the movement of the coder’s thinking as its oscillates between sense-making through the discontinuous, abstract notational form of code and the ‘continuous’ – even sensuous – experience of coding as a lived experience.

## Learning & Teaching

As someone who is new to the whole live coding performance thing, it is veri intimidating to see with hor much fines and focus people can perform these in live events. Because of the sharing nature of the online jam, you not only can look over the shoulder of someone else doing it, you also get access to the code in real time. Seeing how they change it and what effects it has. You can copy out code, and understand how it works. Try out some changes and bring them back into the jam. This allowed me to get the confidence needed to just jam with the others. 

WHen you only see cursors jumping on the it can seem like they know exactly what they are doing. It takes currage to jump in and change a number. Learning that this is ok, and actually encourage is a process. But because you see it happen, it makes doing it a bit easier every time.

The natural high and lows of activity in the shared room create opportunity for people, to be inspired by others jamming, as well as try out there feet, when no one else (or less cursors) are around. The transition from "real performance" and just goofying around for oneselve gets blurry, and before you know it, you lost an hour to a jam with a bunch of people.

## Audience

I love performing to an audience. I find it very exhilarating. But it can sometimes feel self-indulgent. With jamming, this isn't a problem. It's more collaborative or something blah blah blah...

Pastagang has been one of the most ... of my life. ...

For me, **jamming** means high levels of trust, listening and making space for others. I hope to take these skills into other areas of my life...

## Jam Oriented Programming (or another term like that)

talk about nudel and how contributions are approached like a jam as well. everybody can become "maintainer" immediately, being able to change the site without asking. in a jam, communication and decision making happens mostly through the music, less through talking about it. talking is a detour. trust the process. the jam is a SUBSTRATE. similarly, in JOP, people don't need to ask before making a change (they still can if they want to have feedback etc). the software is not part of a critical infrastructure, so breaking it has no severe consequences. similar to how it happens that someone makes a mistake in a jam, it can happen that the thing breaks. it's fine. we even have a backup plan (flok.cc). focusing on a low barrier to entry also means the code should be as easy to understand as possible, so avoiding too many complexities is a good idea. perfection is not the goal. it's better to make a bad contribution than to make no contribution at all.
